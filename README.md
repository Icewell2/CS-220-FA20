CS 220 (Data Programming I) is a gentle introduction to coding for students outside of computer science. 
Our goal is simple: to write Python code to answer questions about real datasets. CS 220 will require you
to practice coding a lot this semester (you'll complete 10 programming projects)! It's a lot of work, but
if you take this course seriously and invest the time, you'll walk away with an incredible new skill: 
the ability to make computers work on your behalf.
